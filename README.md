This repository contains the source for the [Dimensions Of Trust Scale (DOTS)](http://people.wku.edu/richard.miller/Mayer%20Trust%20article.pdf) of [Roger C. Mayer](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/79364000_Roger_C_Mayer), [James H. Davis](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/81323154_James_H_Davis) and [F. David Schoorman](https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/2004290170_F_David_Schoorman). The presented scale version was developed using [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX). Our source is a mirror of both [NASA-TLX](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/nasa-tlx) and [SUS](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI/sus) repositories from the [MIMBCD-UI](https://github.com/MIMBCD-UI) project. Regarding the document content, it is based on the information published on the [Academy of Management](https://www.jstor.org/publisher/aom) for the work titled as *[An Integrative Model of Organizational Trust](http://people.wku.edu/richard.miller/Mayer%20Trust%20article.pdf)* of *[Mayer et al.](http://people.wku.edu/richard.miller/Mayer%20Trust%20article.pdf)* authors. The  method assesses **trust** dimensions on three 20-point scales. Increments of high, medium and low estimates for each point result in several gradations on the scales. The general template can be found on the [`src/`](src/) directory, while the *samples* can be found at [`samples/`](samples/) directory. We used the [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) format, a typesetting system that includes features designed for the production of technical and scientific documentation. [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is available as [free software](https://www.latex-project.org/lppl/).
